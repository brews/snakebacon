Where did the name "snakebacon" come from?
------------------------------------------

The heart of the code is based on the C/C++ from the original Bacon, which is based on an interface in R. I was looking
to write something similar in Python, thus the name "snakebacon" was born in when the package was in early development.
I kept the name because it makes me smile.
